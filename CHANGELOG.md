## 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Design System page** — new "Design" tab (desktop nav) with sticky sidebar navigation; documents all design tokens, components, and interactions in a single living reference page; includes live WCAG contrast-ratio badges computed from actual palette hex values; sidebar scrollspy highlights active section
- **Foundations section** — full neutral palette (13 tokens) + family accent palette (9 tokens) with pass/fail contrast badges; 8-step type scale table (proposed consolidation from 30+ current sizes); 4px spacing grid; 7 border patterns; border-radius inventory (9 current values) with proposed consolidation to 5
- **Components section** — live demos of all button variants (primary, secondary, ghost, danger, icon, pill), tag/chip variants, card patterns (catalog row, scent card, note card, role card), form inputs, and navigation components (desktop tabs, mobile bottom bar, sheet stack); each demo annotated with inline inconsistency callouts
- **Issues tracker** — 8 numbered issues with Hi/Mid/Lo priority: WCAG AA contrast failures on `--g400` (2.7:1) and `--g450` (3.7:1), 30+ unscoped font-size values, 9 border-radius values needing consolidation, missing sticky sheet headers, nav-bar height inconsistency across sheet levels, bottom-nav overlap of sheet content, inconsistent card border patterns, form input sizing variance
- **Team guidelines** — do/don't/note rules for: color (always use palette tokens, never raw hex), typography (3-font-family rule, font-size from scale only), spacing (4px grid, named tokens), borders (2 approved styles), components (composition over custom), and accessibility (WCAG AA floor)
- **Compare tab** — new panel (desktop nav + mobile bottom nav) for side-by-side fragrance comparison; search autocomplete for both slots with family-color-coded results; selected fragrances shown as dismissible chips
- **Venn diagram** — SVG visualization showing the match score (0–100) between two fragrances; circle sizes and overlap reflect computed similarity; family accent colors for each fragrance
- **Notes breakdown** — three-column grid showing notes unique to each fragrance vs. shared notes; each note tagged with layer badge (T = top, H = heart, B = base)
- **Fragrance fingerprint** — SVG radar/spider chart per fragrance across 5 dimensions (freshness, sweetness, warmth, intensity, depth) derived from family profile and sillage/layering values; two fingerprints shown side-by-side for direct visual comparison
- **Key metrics bars** — mirrored horizontal bars comparing sillage and layering values; shared roles highlighted in accent color
- **Suggestions** — 4 "you might also like" cards below each comparison, ranked by maximum similarity score to either selected fragrance
- **Archivo Black font** — added for display headings in the Compare panel; bold editorial feel per v2 design direction

## 2026-03-08 (4)

### Added
- **Fragrance Map** — full-screen pan/zoom canvas replaces the note constellation; all 183 fragrances plotted in family clusters arranged in a ring (9 families, sillage × layering scatter within each); drag to pan, scroll/pinch to zoom, hover shows a tooltip with name, brand, top notes, and up to 3 similarity-connection lines; click a dot closes the map and opens the fragrance detail; minimap in the bottom-right corner shows the full world with a viewport indicator; launched from a new "✦ Open Fragrance Map" button at the top of the Notes tab
- **Detail panel capsule CTA** — static "Assigned to roles" label replaced with a dynamic `"Add to your scentmap"` (shown in accent red, uppercase, when no role is assigned) / `"In your scentmap"` (muted, when at least one role chip is active); unassigned role chips now display a `+` icon to signal they are tappable
- **Picker: new-user flow** — when a user has nothing owned and clicks a role slot, the picker now shows a "Browse all for this role" section listing all tagged fragrances with direct "Add" buttons, plus a hint line; previously showed an unhelpful "mark fragrances as owned first" dead-end
- **Picker: carousel Add buttons** — each card in the "Explore for this role" horizontal carousel now has a "+ Add to capsule" button so users can add directly from the carousel without opening the detail panel
- **Catalog: clickable top notes** — top-note pills in every catalog row are now `<button>` elements; clicking a note opens the floating note popup (showing description and all fragrances that contain it)

### Changed
- `buildConstellation()` repurposed: body reduced to inserting the map launch button; full canvas rendering delegated to new `openFragMap()` / `closeFragMap()` / `_fmDraw()` / `_fmDrawMini()` module-level functions
- Carousel cards changed from `<button>` to `<div>` to allow nested Add `<button>` elements (avoids invalid HTML nesting)
- `renderCatRow()` — `.s-meta` now renders `<button class="s-meta-note">` elements joined by `<span class="s-meta-sep">` for comma separators; note click handlers wired inline after `innerHTML`

## 2026-03-08 (3)

### Added
- **Layering education** — complexity chip (`Balanced` / `Layered` / `Complex` / `Deep`) appears on any catalog row with a layering score ≥ 6, giving instant visual feedback on blending potential; Layering Pairer now opens with a 3-sentence explainer: High = complex structure that layers well; Low = clean linear, best solo
- **Auto-fill Scentmap** — new `autoAssignFromOwned()` assigns the best-scoring owned fragrance (by layering score) to each empty role slot silently; wired to the onboarding "Set up my capsule" CTA and to a persistent "Auto-fill from collection ▸" button in the Scentmap header (hidden once all 8 slots are filled or no owned frags)
- **Capsule role legend** — collapsible "What are these roles? ▾" toggle below the capsule grid expands a full legend showing each role's symbol, name, and long description; hides again with "Hide roles ▴"
- **Capsule role descriptions** — `.cap-desc-short` now renders at legible opacity (0.45–0.55) so the one-line tagline is visible in both empty and filled cells
- **Profile: Best for Layering** — new ranked list (top 5 owned frags by layering score) with proportional bars and Linear→Deep labels; appears whenever ≥1 fragrance is owned
- **Profile: Collection Pairings** — two side-by-side cards: "Most Similar" (highest `scoreSimilarity` pair) and "Best Layering" (highest `scoreLayeringPair`), each with a one-line reason; appears when ≥2 frags are owned
- **Family / brand / role hover highlight** — hovering the coloured family dot (`.s-fdot`) on any catalog row dims all non-matching rows; hovering a brand pill in the brand bar highlights rows for that brand; hovering a role pill in the filter bar highlights rows for that role; all restore on mouse-out
- **Roles: brand filter bar** — horizontally scrollable pill row at the top of the Roles tab filters every role's scatter chart to a single brand; "All brands" pill resets; persists as user scrolls through roles
- **`scoreLayeringPair(a,b)`** — extracted as a module-level scoring function (mirrors the local `scoreLayering` inside the detail panel) for use in Profile comparisons

### Changed
- `renderCatRow()` now sets `data-brand` and `data-roles` attributes on each row for hover-highlight targeting
- `go()` nav selector updated to exclude `.roles-brand-bar .tab` from deactivation sweep

## 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Onboarding flow** — welcome screen on first visit with three entry paths: add your collection, browse the catalog, or explore notes; collection builder lets users mark owned fragrances by role; completes to catalog or scentmap view
- **Taste Profile tab** — new desktop/mobile tab showing owned-collection analysis: family breakdown bar chart, recurring notes, role coverage grid, and sillage sweet-spot indicator; updates live as collection changes
- **Complement/Contrast badges on Discover shelf** — fragrance detail cards in the discover shelf now show family-relationship badges (Complements / Contrasts) based on fragrance family proximity
- **Layering suggestions in fragrance detail** — detail view includes a "Works well with" section surfacing fragrances that layer well based on shared or complementary note families
- **Catalog search** — full-text search bar filtering across fragrance name, brand, and all notes (top/mid/base); includes clear button; filters in real-time as you type
- **Catalog state filter tabs** — All / Owned / Wishlist tabs above the search bar for quick collection views; state persists across catalog role-filter navigation
- **Scentmap as a desktop tab** — removed the fixed left sidebar; Scentmap is now a first-class tab in the main navigation on both desktop and mobile, consistent with all other views
- **23 new fragrances** across three houses, expanding the catalog from 24 to 47 entries:
  - **Byredo** (+14): 1996 Inez & Vinoodh, Pulp, Lil Fleur, Sellier, Inflorescence, Seven Veils, Black Saffron, Baudelaire, Tulipe, Sunday Cologne, Oud Neroli, Rose Noir, Sundazed, Slow Dance
  - **Diptyque** (+8): Eau Rose, Fleur de Peau, Oyedo, Geranium pour Monsieur, Vetyverio, Eau des Sens, Olene, Eau Capitale
  - **Fueguia 1833** (+1): Buenos Aires
- **21 new fragrance notes** added to `data/notes.json` (alphabetically integrated): Angelica, Basil, Blood Orange, Coriander, Fig, Freesia, Honeysuckle, Hyacinth, Lily of the Valley, Lychee, Mimosa, Narcissus, Oakmoss, Pear, Peony, Rhubarb, Saffron, Tangerine, Thyme, Ylang-Ylang, Yuzu

### Changed
- **Bottom sheet animations** — sheets now animate consistently: first sheet slides up from bottom, sub-navigation sheets slide in from the right (`.sheet.nav`); stacked-behind state uses `brightness` filter instead of `scale` for visual consistency
- **Desktop detail panel slide-in** — navigating to a fragrance or note on desktop now triggers a `translateX` fade-in animation instead of an instant content swap

### Fixed
- **Note Constellation crash on init** — `buildConstellation()` was calling `.split(',')` on note fields that are arrays in the JSON, throwing a `TypeError` and silently halting the rest of the init chain (preventing catalog state tabs from wiring up); fixed all three call sites to iterate arrays directly

---

## 2026-03-06

### Fixed
- **JSON data not rendering after externalization** — three bugs introduced when data was forked from inline arrays into external JSON files:
  - Corrupted `NI_MAP` declaration: a stray line number artifact (`1390`) split the assignment in two, and the `const NI_MAP` fragment was accidentally fused onto `function isTablet()`, breaking both
  - `const RM` changed to `let` — was declared `const` but the fetch init block reassigns it after loading `data/roles.json`, causing a silent `TypeError`
  - `const CAT_MAP` changed to `let` — same issue as above for `data/scents.json`

### Added
- `data/scents.json` — fragrance catalog (24 entries) extracted from inline JavaScript in `index.html`
- `data/notes.json` — notes reference index (75 entries) extracted from inline JavaScript in `index.html`
- `data/roles.json` — roles definition (8 entries) extracted from inline JavaScript in `index.html`
- `.claude/launch.json` — dev server configuration for local preview

### Changed
- `index.html` now loads all data via `fetch()` from the three external JSON files instead of hardcoded inline arrays, enabling data to be managed independently of the app logic

---

## 2026-03-06 — Initial

- Renamed `scentmap_7.html` to `index.html`
- Initial app: single-file fragrance capsule tool with 24 scents across Byredo, Fueguia 1833, Xinú, and Diptyque; 8 roles; 75 notes
